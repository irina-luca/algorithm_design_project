# M4 => 2017-04-23

1. Randomized data vs. clustered data =>
    - randomized data might get closer to LSH in the way points are separated (spheres might do the same as hyperplanes) => must investigate
    - test the radius of the spheres to see if we reduce to LSH (hypercube ???)

2. Fig. 7 from the paper can just as well have recall on the y-axis (same same)

3. Make #clusters a parameter => lower stddev while increasing the number of clusters

4. Compare these three measures:
    - common hyperspheres (|x and y|)
    - SHD
    - Jaccard (this one might be best to use)
    
5. Random data, random pivots => check with the angle between points (x, y) => the expected #common spheres is = 1 - alpha/pi
