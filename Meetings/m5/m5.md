# M5 => 2017-05-01

- experimaent => try random spheres
- finish jaccard vs. other measures experiment (not on the same training and test files)
- run SphH code found online
- num. of iterations = 0 => what happens?
- maybe other ways to generate spheres


Summary:
1. Generate spheres
2. Move spheres around
3. Measures and similarity
4. Iterations and Running time
