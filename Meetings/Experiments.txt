Testing whether we're essentially just doing the same as spectral hashing:
	Create the following random data:
		- Uniform random data
		- Clustered random data
		- 10D & 257D
		- 0C & 6C
		- 10.000

	Train the network with the different data
		- Limited number of hyperspheres(ex. 8-16)

	Measure the hyperspheres generated by the training
		- Size
		- Positioning

	We're using high dimensional data, which means that the euclidean distance will wary according to the number of dimensions.
		- Use a different distance metric?
